# Relationship between illiquidity and market efficiency 

This paper examines the relationship between illiquidity and market efficiency in the GameStop case study. By executing intraday trading study between 27th January 2021 to 29th January 2021, which is the period where the restriction policy was announced. The results show that for each day illiquidity causes a reduction in market efficiency. However, the most illiquid day (28th. January 2021) is the day with the smallest price predictability. This result indicates that the traders react to new information about the restriction, which leads to adverse selection problem that the market makers have to expand the spread.
